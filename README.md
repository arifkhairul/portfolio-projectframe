# Portfolio - Projectframe - Interactive Map

## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)<br><br>
If you don’t know if Node.js is already installed or which version is installed, open your Terminal (MacOS) or Command Prompt (Windows) and run <b>node -v</b><br>

If it’s installed, the answer will contain the current version. Make sure it’s updated to the last version. Vite currently works with version 14.18 and above, but I recommend you always have the <b>LTS (Long Term Support) version</b> of Node.js installed.<br><br>

VS Code > Terminal > Run this followed commands:
``` bash
# Install dependencies (only for first time) | [node_modules] folder
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:5173
npm run dev

---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Build for production | [dist] folder
npm run build
```
